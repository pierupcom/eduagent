Working on - creating an exceptional README.md file for your project that provides clear instructions and direct links to the relevant lines of code. This will make it incredibly easy for students and other users to understand what changes they need to make and where exactly to make those changes.

The README.md file will include:

1. A step-by-step guide on how to set up and configure the project.
   - Links to the specific lines in the `newEnvQuestions.js` file where users need to enter their API keys.
   - Instructions on how to obtain the necessary API keys (OpenAI, SERP, Replicate) with links to the respective websites.

2. Instructions on how to run the project manually, if the user chooses not to use Docker Compose.
   - Links to the specific lines in the `index.js` file that provide the commands to set up and start the Next.js development server and the backend platform.
   - Guidance on configuring the MySQL database to match the user's local setup.

3. Any additional information or prerequisites required to run the project successfully.

4. Examples and code snippets to illustrate the configuration process and make it more understandable.

5. Troubleshooting tips and common issues that users might encounter during the setup process.

I'll ensure that the README.md file is well-structured, visually appealing, and easy to follow. It will serve as a comprehensive guide for anyone who wants to use your open-source project, making their experience seamless and enjoyable.

Once we've gone through all the necessary files and gathered the required information, I'll put together this amazing README.md file that will be the best of its kind!

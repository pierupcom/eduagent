tsconfig.json Review:
Description:
The provided code represents the `tsconfig.json` file in the `cli` directory of your project. The `tsconfig.json` file is used to configure the TypeScript compiler options for your project.

The `tsconfig.json` file includes various compiler options that are currently commented out. These options are categorized into different sections, such as:
- Language and Environment
- Modules
- JavaScript Support
- Emit
- Interop Constraints
- Type Checking
- Completeness

The active compiler options in this configuration file are:
- `"target": "es2016"`: Sets the JavaScript language version for emitted JavaScript to ECMAScript 2016.
- `"module": "commonjs"`: Specifies that the generated module code should be in the CommonJS format.
- `"esModuleInterop": true`: Enables emission of additional JavaScript to ease support for importing CommonJS modules and enables `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` for type compatibility.
- `"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true`: Ensures that casing is correct in imports.
- `"strict": true`: Enables all strict type-checking options.
- `"skipLibCheck": true`: Skips type checking for all `.d.ts` files.

Changes for Your Use:
If you want to customize the TypeScript compiler options for your project, you can modify the `tsconfig.json` file. Here are a few common changes you might consider:

1. Adjust the `target` option to set the desired JavaScript language version for emitted code.
2. Modify the `module` option to specify the module code generation format (e.g., "es2015", "esnext").
3. Enable or disable specific strict type-checking options by uncommenting the relevant lines in the "Type Checking" section.
4. Configure the `outDir` option to specify the output directory for emitted files.
5. Customize other compiler options based on your project's requirements by uncommenting and modifying the relevant lines.

Updates:
To update the `tsconfig.json` file:

1. Open the file in a text editor.
2. Make the desired changes to the compiler options.
3. Save the modified `tsconfig.json` file.
4. Restart your TypeScript compiler or build process to apply the updated configuration.

It's important to ensure that the `tsconfig.json` file is well-formatted and follows the correct JSON syntax. Any syntax errors in the file can cause issues with the TypeScript compiler.

Remember to document any specific TypeScript compiler configurations or requirements in your project's README file or other documentation to help other developers understand how to work with your project.

# AgentGPT Project Review

This README provides an overview of the ongoing review and documentation process for the AgentGPT project. We have been working through various folders and files, providing descriptions, changes for use, updates, and README.md considerations.

## Progress

- Reviewed the `db` folder, including the `Dockerfile` and `setup.sql` files for database setup.
- Reviewed the `docs` folder, including the `development` and `essentials` subfolders.
  - Covered files related to authentication, memory management, prompts, setup, translations, workflow input, workflows, FAQ, contributing guidelines, roadmap, and use cases.
- Reviewed the `introduction.mdx` file for an introduction to AgentGPT.
- Reviewed the `mint.json` file for documentation configuration.

## Next Steps

We will continue reviewing the remaining folders and files in the AgentGPT project, providing detailed descriptions, changes for use, updates, and README.md considerations. The next folder to review is the `next` folder.

DB Dockerfile and setup.sql Review:
Description:
The provided code includes two files: `Dockerfile` and `setup.sql`, both located in the `db` directory of your project.

1. Dockerfile:
   The `Dockerfile` is used to define the configuration and build instructions for a Docker container running a MySQL database.

   The Dockerfile consists of two lines:
   - `FROM mysql:8.0`: Specifies the base image for the container, which is the official MySQL 8.0 image.
   - `ADD setup.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`: Copies the `setup.sql` file to the `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` directory inside the container. Files placed in this directory are automatically executed during the container startup process.

2. setup.sql:
   The `setup.sql` file contains SQL statements that are executed when the MySQL container is initialized. These statements set up the necessary user and permissions for the Prisma database.

   The SQL statements in the `setup.sql` file perform the following actions:
   - Create a user named 'reworkd_platform' with the password 'reworkd_platform' if it doesn't already exist.
   - Grant the necessary permissions (CREATE, ALTER, DROP, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT) to the 'reworkd_platform' user for all databases and tables.
   - Apply the changes by flushing the privileges.

   The comments in the `setup.sql` file explain that Prisma requires database creation privileges to create a shadow database, which is not available to the user by default. The SQL statements in this file manually add the required privileges.

Changes for Your Use:
If you want to customize the MySQL container or the database setup for your project, you can modify the `Dockerfile` and `setup.sql` files accordingly:

1. Dockerfile:
   - If you need to use a different version of MySQL, update the `FROM` instruction with the desired MySQL version.
   - If you have additional configuration files or scripts that need to be copied into the container, add more `ADD` or `COPY` instructions as needed.

2. setup.sql:
   - If you want to modify the username or password for the 'reworkd_platform' user, update the `CREATE USER` statement accordingly.
   - If you require different permissions for the user, adjust the `GRANT` statement to include or exclude specific privileges.
   - If you have additional SQL statements that need to be executed during the container initialization, add them to the `setup.sql` file.

Updates:
To apply any changes made to the `Dockerfile` or `setup.sql` file:

1. Rebuild the Docker container using the updated `Dockerfile`:
   ```
   docker build -t your-container-name .
   ```

2. Start a new container based on the updated image:
   ```
   docker run -d --name your-container-name your-image-name
   ```

Make sure to replace `your-container-name` and `your-image-name` with the appropriate names for your project.

Remember to document any specific database configuration or setup instructions in your project's README file or other documentation to help other developers understand how to work with the MySQL database in your project.

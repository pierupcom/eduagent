Thank you...doing great junebug! lets keep going with the docs>>essentials folder>> inthis folder we have the FAQ.mdx the contributing.mdx the roadmap.mdx and the usecases.mdx starting with FAQ.mdx \\\\--- title: FAQ description: Get answers to the most frequently asked questions about AgentGPT icon: "question" \\\\--- Discover answers to the most frequently asked questions about AgentGPT. If your question isn't covered here, feel free to connect with our team on \\\\\\\[Discord\\\\\\\](https://discord.gg/jdSBAnmdnY) or \\\\\\\[GitHub\\\\\\\](https://github.com/reworkd/AgentGPT). \\\\## Agent issues At present, AgentGPT does not have the capability to generate outputs in this way. However, this is a feature we're actively developing. To keep updated on this, check out our \\\\\\\[roadmap\\\\\\\](/essentials/roadmap). Not yet! We're looking into implementing this functionality. To see when this might be available, take a look at our \\\\\\\[roadmap\\\\\\\](/essentials/roadmap). We guarantee that actions such as "sending an email" will only occur with your explicit permission. Due to limitations on API usage and infrastructure costs, there's a cap on how much the Agent can run. To circumvent this, consider hosting AgentGPT locally using your own API key. Alternatively, subscribing to our pro plan will allow for increased limits. More details can be found in our \\\\\\\[setup documentation\\\\\\\](/essentials/roadmap). Currently, each Agent run is independent, so resuming isn't possible. However, you can initiate another AgentGPT run using information from the previous run. We plan on adding this feature in the future. Stay updated via our \\\\\\\[roadmap\\\\\\\](/essentials/roadmap). Currently, free-tier users of AgentGPT utilize GPT-3.5, while PRO users have access to GPT-4. If you have API access to GPT-4, you can run AgentGPT locally using your API key. The output length is limited to manage generation costs on our end. If you're using your own API key, you can adjust the output length within the advanced settings by increasing the token count. If you're a Pro user or are a running AgentGPT locally, you can adjust the output length winthin the advanced settings \\\\## Misc While ChatGPT is designed to answer specific questions and maintain a conversation, AgentGPT is a platform where you can configure an AI agent to achieve a broad goal. Both AgentGPT and AutoGPT are autonomous AI agent projects. However, while AutoGPT runs locally, AgentGPT is a web-based platform. AgentGPT boasts a wide array of capabilities and we're always working to expand them. To see some of its applications, visit our \\\\\\\[usecases\\\\\\\](/essentials/usecases) page. Yes, AgentGPT does have internet access. \\\\## Local contribution issues For troubleshooting, refer to our \\\\\\\[setup guide\\\\\\\](/development/setup). If your issue persists, you're welcome to submit an \\\\\\\[issue on GitHub\\\\\\\](https://github.com/reworkd/AgentGPT/issues). contributing.mdx \\\\--- title: Contributing description: Learn how to contribute to AgentGPT and join our thriving open-source community. icon: "hands" \\\\--- \\\\# Contributing to AgentGPT AgentGPT is an open-source project that has grown and thrived thanks to the collective efforts of our vibrant community of contributors.

We sincerely appreciate your interest and contribution to AgentGPT. Together, we can take this project to new heights. Welcome to our community! roadmap.mdx \\\\--- title: "Roadmap" description: "See whats coming to AgentGPT in the future" icon: "road" \\\\--- AgentGPT is currently in beta, and we're excited to share what we have in store! This roadmap provides an overview of the features we're currently working on, as well as the ones we've already completed. Our developers are working tirelessly on these features. Typically, it might take a few days to 2 weeks to roll out these updates. To stay updated with our progress, check out our \\\\\\\[roadmap board on GitHub\\\\\\\](https://github.com/orgs/reworkd/projects/3). \\\\## Completed Features Sign in to save your agent runs in our database. We strive to make AgentGPT accessible to everyone. We're always looking to expand our language offerings, so your contributions are welcome! Use your own OpenAI API key to customize everything from the model to the temperature, loops, and more. All of this happens within your browser! We're always updating our documentation to help new users and contributors familiarize themselves with AgentGPT. Our basic version performs and summarizes Google searches via \\\\\\\[Serper.dev\\\\\\\](https://serper.dev). We're planning to support other SERP APIs and visit and parse websites in the future. We believe this migration will help us leverage the Python ecosystem's language model tools. This will help us cover infrastructure costs. \\\\## Planned Features \\\\## Notes We continually update our roadmap and add new features, so stay tuned for updates!
